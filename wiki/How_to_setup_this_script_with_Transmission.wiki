==Through Transmission interface==

In the transmission GUI, enable the "_call script when torrent is completed_" option and select the path to the torrentexpander.sh script.
You're done !

==Through text editor==

You can also do it the command line way by editing Transmission's settings file <br />(_/$HOME/.config/Transmission/settings.json_  or   _/share/.transmission/settings.json_)
and editing those two lines :<br />

{{{
"script-torrent-done-enabled": true,
"script-torrent-done-filename": "/path/to/torrentexpander.sh $TR_TORRENT_DIR/$TR_TORRENT_NAME"
}}}

On the PopcornHour C200 / A200 / A210, you'll need to enable SSH access to your NMT and chmod +x the script to allow it to run.

*Also make sure that the user that runs Transmission has write permission on your destination_folder.*<br />

With some versions of Transmission, you may need to use this line instead in Transmission's settings file :<br />

{{{
"script-torrent-done-filename": "/path/to/torrentexpander.sh"
}}}
