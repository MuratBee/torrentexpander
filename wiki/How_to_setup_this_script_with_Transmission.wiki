In the transmission GUI, enable the "call script when torrent is completed" option and select the path to the torrentexpander.sh script. You're done !<br />
<br />
You can also do it the command line way by editing Transmission's settings file <br />(/$HOME/.config/Transmission/settings.json  or   /share/.transmission/settings.json)
and editing those two lines :<br />
"script-torrent-done-enabled": true,<br />
"script-torrent-done-filename": "/path/to/torrentexpander.sh $TR_TORRENT_DIR/$TR_TORRENT_NAME" <br />

On the PopCornHour C200 / A200 / A210, you'll need to enable SSH access to your NMT and chmod +x the script to allow it to run.

*Also make sure that the user that runs Transmission has write permission on your destination_folder.*<br />

With some versions of Transmission, you may need to use this line instead in Transmission's settings file :<br />
"script-torrent-done-filename": "/path/to/torrentexpander.sh $TR_TORRENT_DIR/$TR_TORRENT_NAME"
