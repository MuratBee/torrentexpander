torrentexpander can be launched as a daemon by the Transmission torrent client of by Flexget.
It can also be run manually : in that case you'll get a basic GUI that will enable you to choose a torrent file or folder and the destination where it should be expanded.
It can expand rar archives (including multipart) and zip archives, but it can also manage many audio and video files.
It can also solve numbering issues on TV series and cleanup filenames.
It also has the ability to move TV series / movies / music files to a folder of your choice.
On Ubuntu and Debian, it can interact with third party apps like ccd2iso (to convert IMG to ISO) and mkvdts2ac3 (to convert a DTS track from a MKV into an AC3 track)
